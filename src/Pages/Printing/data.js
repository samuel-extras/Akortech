details: 
` printing press is a mechanical device for applying pressure to an
 inked surface resting upon a print medium (such as paper or cloth),
  thereby transferring the ink. It marked a dramatic improvement on
   earlier printing methods in which the cloth, paper or other 
   medium was brushed or rubbed repeatedly to achieve the transfer 
   of ink, and accelerated the process. Typically used for texts,
    the invention and global spread of the printing press was one 
    of the most influential events in the second millennium.
