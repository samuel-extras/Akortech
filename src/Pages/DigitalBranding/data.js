    Digital branding carries a fundamental weight on a company’s success. It’s what makes the difference between a great brand and a brand that goes unnoticed.
    
    However, let’s set the record straight. A good digital branding strategy is not limited to large companies − in fact, any SME or start-up can enjoy its benefits.
    Digital branding consists of the actions that are carried out aimed at building a brand in digital media. Marketing pursues that needs are met through products or services. Branding, on the other hand, goes further than this: it’s about creating brands that connect with their audience and convey a series of values.
    
    Nonetheless, branding is not something new. The concept of digital branding has been born simply because the areas in which branding can be applied have expanded with today’s widespread use of the internet, social media, mobile apps, etc. Hence, a brand’s positioning strategies are currently virtually obliged to go omnichannel and have a unique approach.
