Computer programming is the process that professionals use to write 
code that instructs how a computer, application or software program
 performs. At its most basic, computer programming is a set of 
 instructions to facilitate specific actions. Computer programmers 
 create instructions for a computer to execute by writing and
  testing code that enables applications and software programs to
   operate successfully.
Computers can do amazing things, from basic laptops capable of 
simple word processing and spreadsheet functions to incredibly 
complex supercomputers completing millions of financial 
transactions a day and controlling the infrastructure that 
makes modern life possible. But no computer can do anything until a
 computer programmer tells it to behave in specific ways. Thatâ€™s
  what computer programming is all about. 

At its most basic, computer programming is little more than a set 
of instructions to facilitate specific actions. Based on the
 requirements or purposes of these instructions, computer  
 programming can be as simple as adding two numbers. It can also 
 be as complex as reading data from temperature sensors to adjust
  a thermostat, sorting data to complete intricate scheduling or 
  critical reports or taking players through multi-layered worlds
   and challenges in games.
